        <h3>1st: Godfather Part I</h3>
        <p>As it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and played by prominent actors like: Al Pacino and Marlin Brando, it is regarded as one of the best movies ever created.</p>

        <h3>2nd: The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
        <p> Personally my favorite movie of all time. Going into to this movie I was not expecting to be blown away by such a good movie. 11/10! Definitely recommend.</p>

        <h3>3rd: Shutter Island</h3>
        <p> Another one of my favorits, and also being directed by my favorite director Martin Scorsese. As this movie brings you along a journey and with the leading actor being Leonardo DiCaprio this movie definitely belongs in my top 3.</p>
